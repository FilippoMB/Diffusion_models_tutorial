## Prompt engineering guide
Let's say you want to draw an image of ``lion``. The raw promt, ``lion`` will give you images that are usually chaotic or of bad quality.

To obtain better results, the prompt should be egineered. A basic recipe is the following:

``raw prompt`` + ``style`` + ``artist`` + ``details``

- Examples of ``style`` are: *Portrait*, *Realistic*, *Oil painting*, *Pencil drawing*, *Concept art*
- Examples of ``artist`` are: Jan van Eyck (when ``style`` = *Portrait*), *Vincent Van Gogh* (when ``style`` = *Oil painting*), *Leonardo Da Vinci* (when ``style`` = *Pencil drawing*), and so on. Note that you can also mix artists, to get original results.
- Examples of ``details`` are *Unreal Engine* if you want to add realistic lightining, *8 k* if you want to add more details, *artstation* if you want to make your image more artistic, and so on.

Example prompt: 

*"retrofuturistic portrait of a lion in astro suit, space graphics art in background, close up, wlop, dan mumford, artgerm, liam brazier, peter mohrbacher, 8 k, raw, featured in artstation, octane render, cinematic, elegant, intricate, 8 k"*
