# Diffusion models tutorial 

A while ago [Stable Diffusion Public Release](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) made available to everyone one of the most powerful deep learning models for image generation. 

This repository contains:

- Tutorials on the theory behind diffusion models and the software libraries used to implement them.
- A step-by-step guide on how to implement a diffusion model from scratch.
- A collection of scripts and notebooks that can be used to generate images with Stable Diffusion.
- A basic guide to prompt engineering.
- A list of resources to dig deeper into the world of diffusion models.

## 1. üöÄ Quick start

### üß± Learn the basics

Check these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jUO9jZLtUGoK7kgg0kurBgDwDsNOLybrYKU-O2y98xM/edit?usp=sharing) for a short introduction about the basic idea behind diffusion models and stable diffusion.

### üíª Play with notebooks

> [!WARNING] 
> Since the libraries used in the notebooks below are often updated, the notebooks might stop working at some point. Please, open an issue if you encounter problems and bugs.

Try out **Stable Diffusion** by running one of the Colab notebooks below.

### ü§ì Understand the theory and learn to build pipelines

- Understand the theory behind stable diffusion models and learn how to code a simple diffusion model from scratch in [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/FilippoMB/Diffusion_models_tutorial/blob/main/diffusion_from_scratch.ipynb).
- Become familiar with the stable diffusion pipeline and the diffusers üß® library  in [this notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/FilippoMB/Diffusion_models_tutorial/blob/main/Diffusers_library.ipynb).

To run the notebooks you need to have several libraries installed. You can do that by installing Anaconda (or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/)) and then creating the environment using the provided env files.

First, try to create the environment using [environment.yml](https://github.com/FilippoMB/Diffusion_models_tutorial/blob/main/environment.yml):

````bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
````

If that doesn't work, try with [env_flex.yml](https://github.com/FilippoMB/Diffusion_models_tutorial/blob/main/env_flex.yml) that allows for a more flexible installation. 

````bash
conda env create -f env_flex.yml
````

The risk here is that it will install more recent versions of the software packages and the notebooks might give some errors.
You might need to this more flexible install also if you are on Windows.
If you are on MacOS, instead, use [env_mac.yml](https://github.com/FilippoMB/Diffusion_models_tutorial/blob/main/env_mac.yml):

````bash
conda env create -f env_flex.yml
````

## 2. üë∑üèª Prompt engineering guide
Let's say you want to draw an image of ``lion``. The raw prompt, ``lion`` will give you images that are usually a bit chaotic or of worse quality.


<div>
<img src="./img/lion_short.png" width="250"/>
</div>

To obtain better results, the prompt should be engineered. A basic recipe is the following:

``raw prompt`` + ``style`` + ``artist`` + ``details``

- Examples of ``style`` are: *Portrait*, *Realistic*, *Oil painting*, *Pencil drawing*, *Concept art*
- Examples of ``artist`` are: Jan van Eyck (when ``style`` = *Portrait*), *Vincent Van Gogh* (when ``style`` = *Oil painting*), *Leonardo Da Vinci* (when ``style`` = *Pencil drawing*), and so on. Note that you can also mix artists, to get original results.
- Examples of ``details`` are *Unreal Engine* if you want to add realistic lightining, *8 k* if you want to add more details, *artstation* if you want to make your image more artistic, and so on.

Example of elaborated prompts: 

*"Professional photograph of a lion with a black mane, high quality, highly detailed, award-winning, hd, 8k, awe-inspirin"*

<div>
<img src="./img/lion_long1.png" width="600"/>
</div>


*"retrofuturistic portrait of a lion in astro suit, space graphics art in background, close up, wlop, dan mumford, artgerm, liam brazier, peter mohrbacher, raw, featured in artstation, octane render, cinematic, elegant, intricate, 8 k"*

<div>
<img src="./img/lion_long.png" width="600"/>
</div>
